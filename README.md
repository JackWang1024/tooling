### Webpack

Webpack 2 is the bundler **tooling** used under the hood.

### Babel

**tooling** transforms all js file by using Babel with `es2015-webpack` and `stage-1`, which means all ES6/7 and stage-1 features are supported.

### HTML

By default **tooling** generates an `index.html` with `<div id="app"></div>` in `body` element for you, and all bundled scripts are automatically injected to the HTML. By passing arg `--no-html` to disable this behavior.

### CSS

CSS files are transformed by PostCSS, and `CSS modules` are enabled by default.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install -g tooling
```

## Usage

```bash
# the default entry is index.js
$ tooling # equal to
$ tooling index.js

# build for production use
$ tooling -p

$ tooling --help
```
